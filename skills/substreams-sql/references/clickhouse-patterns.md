# ClickHouse Patterns and Optimization

Advanced patterns for high-performance analytics with ClickHouse and Substreams.

> **Mode lock:** ClickHouse uses **From proto definition only** (`substreams-sink-sql from-proto`). Do not use `DatabaseChanges` / `db_out` / `setup`+`run` CDC against ClickHouse in this skill path.

## Primary key must prefix ORDER BY (from-proto / hosted)

`substreams-sink-sql` builds ClickHouse tables as `ReplacingMergeTree(_version_, _deleted_)` with:

| DDL clause | Source in protobuf |
|---|---|
| `PRIMARY KEY (…)` | Fields with `[(schema.field) = { primary_key: true }]` |
| `ORDER BY (…)` | `schema.table.clickhouse_table_options.order_by_fields` |
| `PARTITION BY (…)` | `partition_fields` (prefer `toYYYYMM(_block_timestamp_)`) |

**ClickHouse rule:** the primary key **must be a prefix of the sorting key**.

```text
# Typical failure from a Raydium/Solana event proto:
PRIMARY KEY (id)  ORDER BY (slot, id)
→ DB::Exception: Primary key must be a prefix of the sorting key,
  but the column in the position 0 is slot, not id
```

| Bad | Good |
|---|---|
| PK `id`, ORDER BY `slot, id` | PK `id`, ORDER BY `id` or `id, slot` |
| PK `id`, ORDER BY `slot, signature, id` | PK `slot, id`, ORDER BY `slot, id` |

**Safe defaults for event rows:**

1. **Identity-first:** one unique `id` (e.g. `signature` + ordinal) as sole PK; `order_by_fields = [id]` or `[id, slot]`.
2. **Time-first:** put the leading query column in **both** PK and ORDER BY: e.g. PK `(slot, id)` and `order_by_fields = [slot, id]`.

**Partitioning:** use coarse keys only. Prefer `partition_fields: [{ name: "_block_timestamp_", function: toYYYYMM }]`. Do **not** partition by raw `slot` (huge partition counts).

Before deploying a hosted ClickHouse sink, verify: *ordered PK field names === leading segment of `order_by_fields`*.

## ClickHouse-Optimized Schema Design

### MergeTree Engine Configuration

```sql

    0 as volume_usd,
    0 as velocity,
    0 as concentration
FROM erc20_transfers
GROUP BY contract_address, toStartOfHour(block_timestamp);
```

### Advanced Data Types and Compression

```sql
-- Optimized storage with compression
CREATE TABLE erc20_transfers_compressed (

    unique_contracts UInt32 MATERIALIZED length(arrayDistinct(addresses))
    
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (block_number, tx_hash)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

## High-Performance Analytics Queries

### Time-Series Analysis

```sql

    date,
    daily_volume,
    transfer_count,
    unique_participants,
    
    -- Moving averages

        ORDER BY date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as volume_7d_avg,
    
    avg(transfer_count) OVER (

FROM daily_volumes
WHERE contract_address IN (
    SELECT contract_address 
    FROM erc20_transfers 
    WHERE date >= today() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
    GROUP BY contract_address 
    HAVING sum(amount_formatted) > 1000000  -- Focus on high-volume tokens
)
ORDER BY contract_address, date;

-- Hourly activity patterns
SELECT

    quantile(0.99)(amount_formatted) as p99_transfer
    
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY hour_of_day, day_of_week
ORDER BY day_of_week, hour_of_day;
```

### Advanced Aggregation Patterns

```sql
-- Multi-dimensional token analysis
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    token_symbol,
    
    -- Volume metrics
    sum(amount_formatted) as total_volume,
    count() as transfer_count,
    
    -- User metrics
    uniq(from_addr) as unique_senders,
    uniq(to_addr) as unique_receivers, 
    uniq(from_addr, to_addr) as total_unique_users,
    
    -- Distribution metrics
    quantile(0.1)(amount_formatted) as p10_transfer,
    quantile(0.5)(amount_formatted) as median_transfer,
    quantile(0.9)(amount_formatted) as p90_transfer,
    
    -- Concentration metrics
    sum(if(amount_formatted > quantile(0.9)(amount_formatted), amount_formatted, 0)) 
    / sum(amount_formatted) as top_10pct_volume_share,
    
    -- Activity patterns
    countIf(toHour(block_timestamp) BETWEEN 9 AND 17) / count() as business_hours_ratio,
    countIf(toDayOfWeek(block_timestamp) IN (6, 7)) / count() as weekend_ratio,
    
    -- Growth metrics
    countIf(block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY) as transfers_24h,
    countIf(block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY) as transfers_7d,
    countIf(block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY) as transfers_30d,
    
    -- Velocity (daily volume / market cap estimate)
    sum(amount_formatted) / (max(block_number) - min(block_number)) * 7200 as daily_velocity_estimate
    
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY contract_address, token_symbol
HAVING transfer_count > 100  -- Filter for active tokens
ORDER BY total_volume DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Cross-token correlation analysis  
WITH token_daily_volumes AS (
    SELECT 
        contract_address,
        toDate(block_timestamp) as date,
        sum(amount_formatted) as daily_volume
    FROM erc20_transfers
    WHERE toDate(block_timestamp) >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
    GROUP BY contract_address, date
),
token_pairs AS (
    SELECT 
        a.contract_address as token_a,
        b.contract_address as token_b, 
        a.date,
        a.daily_volume as volume_a,
        b.daily_volume as volume_b
    FROM token_daily_volumes a
    JOIN token_daily_volumes b ON a.date = b.date
    WHERE a.contract_address < b.contract_address  -- Avoid duplicate pairs
      AND a.daily_volume > 10000 AND b.daily_volume > 10000  -- High volume only
)
SELECT 
    token_a,
    token_b,
    count() as days_active,
    corr(volume_a, volume_b) as volume_correlation,
    
    -- Synchronized activity detection
    countIf(volume_a > avgIf(volume_a, volume_a > 0) AND volume_b > avgIf(volume_b, volume_b > 0)) 
    / count() as high_activity_sync_ratio
    
FROM token_pairs
GROUP BY token_a, token_b
HAVING days_active >= 20  -- Sufficient data points
ORDER BY abs(volume_correlation) DESC;
```

### Real-time Analytics with Projections

```sql
-- Create projection for common query patterns
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers ADD PROJECTION hourly_token_stats (
    SELECT 
        contract_address,
        toStartOfHour(block_timestamp) as hour,
        count() as transfer_count,
        sum(amount) as total_volume,
        uniq(from_addr) as unique_senders,
        uniq(to_addr) as unique_receivers
    GROUP BY contract_address, hour
    ORDER BY contract_address, hour
);

-- Materialize the projection
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers MATERIALIZE PROJECTION hourly_token_stats;

-- Query automatically uses projection
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    hour,
    transfer_count,
    total_volume,
    unique_senders + unique_receivers as total_unique_addresses
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE contract_address = '0xA0b86a33E6Fe17d67C8c086c6c4c0E3C8E3B7EC2'  -- USDC
  AND hour >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

## Distributed and Sharded Deployments

### Cluster Configuration

```sql
-- Create distributed table across cluster
CREATE TABLE erc20_transfers_distributed AS erc20_transfers
ENGINE = Distributed('clickhouse_cluster', 'default', 'erc20_transfers', cityHash64(contract_address));

-- Replicated MergeTree for high availability  
CREATE TABLE erc20_transfers_replicated (
    -- Same schema as before
    block_number UInt64,
    block_timestamp DateTime,
    contract_address String,
    -- ... other columns
) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/erc20_transfers', '{replica}')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(toDate(block_timestamp))
ORDER BY (contract_address, block_timestamp, block_number)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

-- Sharding strategy by token contract
CREATE TABLE erc20_transfers_sharded AS erc20_transfers_replicated
ENGINE = Distributed('clickhouse_cluster', 'default', 'erc20_transfers_replicated', 
                     intHash64(cityHash64(contract_address)));
```

### Optimized Ingestion Patterns

```yaml
# Manifest sink configuration for ClickHouse — From proto definition only
# Output module must be your annotated proto, NOT DatabaseChanges
sink:
  module: map_transfer
  type: sf.substreams.sink.sql.v1.Service
  config: {}
```

```bash
# Run with from-proto (ClickHouse does not use Database Changes setup+run)
substreams-sink-sql from-proto "clickhouse://default:@clickhouse-cluster:9000/blockchain" ./substreams.yaml
```

### Bulk Data Operations

```sql
-- Efficient bulk insertion using INSERT SELECT
INSERT INTO erc20_transfers 
SELECT 
    block_number,
    block_timestamp,
    tx_hash,
    log_index,
    contract_address,
    from_addr,
    to_addr,
    amount,
    toStartOfHour(block_timestamp) as hour,
    toDate(block_timestamp) as date,
    toMonday(toDate(block_timestamp)) as week_start,
    toStartOfMonth(toDate(block_timestamp)) as month_start,
    -- Token metadata from dictionary lookup
    dictGetString('token_metadata', 'symbol', contract_address) as token_symbol,
    dictGetUInt8('token_metadata', 'decimals', contract_address) as token_decimals
FROM staging_transfers
WHERE processed = 0;

-- Optimize for bulk operations
SET max_insert_block_size = 1048576;
SET max_threads = 16;
SET max_memory_usage = 10000000000;  -- 10GB for large operations

-- Use async INSERT for high throughput
INSERT INTO erc20_transfers SETTINGS async_insert=1, wait_for_async_insert=0
VALUES (...);
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Query Optimization

```sql
-- Use SAMPLE for large dataset analysis
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    count() * 10 as estimated_transfers,  -- Scale up sample
    avg(amount_formatted) as avg_transfer
FROM erc20_transfers SAMPLE 0.1  -- 10% sample
WHERE block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY contract_address
ORDER BY estimated_transfers DESC;

-- Optimize GROUP BY with pre-filtering
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    sum(amount_formatted) as total_volume
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE contract_address IN (
    -- Pre-filter to top contracts
    SELECT contract_address 
    FROM (
        SELECT contract_address, count() as tx_count
        FROM erc20_transfers 
        WHERE block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
        GROUP BY contract_address 
        ORDER BY tx_count DESC 
        LIMIT 100
    )
)
AND block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY contract_address
ORDER BY total_volume DESC;

-- Use LIMIT BY for top-N per group efficiently
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    from_addr,
    sum(amount_formatted) as total_sent
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE block_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY contract_address, from_addr
ORDER BY contract_address, total_sent DESC
LIMIT 10 BY contract_address;  -- Top 10 senders per token
```

### Memory and Resource Management

```sql
-- Optimize aggregation memory usage
SET max_memory_usage = 20000000000;  -- 20GB
SET group_by_two_level_threshold = 100000;
SET group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes = 1000000000;

-- Use external sorting for large results
SET max_bytes_before_external_group_by = 10000000000;
SET max_bytes_before_external_sort = 10000000000;

-- Parallel query execution
SET max_threads = 16;
SET max_distributed_connections = 16;

-- Memory-efficient window functions
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    block_timestamp,
    amount_formatted,
    -- Use frame-limited window functions
    sum(amount_formatted) OVER (
        PARTITION BY contract_address 
        ORDER BY block_timestamp 
        ROWS BETWEEN 1000 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as running_volume_1000_transfers
FROM erc20_transfers
WHERE contract_address = '0xA0b86a33E6Fe17d67C8c086c6c4c0E3C8E3B7EC2'
ORDER BY block_timestamp;
```

### Storage Optimization

```sql
-- TTL for automated data lifecycle
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers MODIFY TTL toDate(block_timestamp) + INTERVAL 2 YEAR;

-- Tiered storage with different TTLs
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers MODIFY TTL 
    toDate(block_timestamp) + INTERVAL 90 DAY TO DISK 'hdd',
    toDate(block_timestamp) + INTERVAL 2 YEAR DELETE;

-- Compression optimization by column
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers 
    MODIFY COLUMN amount Codec(Delta, ZSTD),
    MODIFY COLUMN block_number Codec(Delta, ZSTD),
    MODIFY COLUMN block_timestamp Codec(DoubleDelta, ZSTD);

-- Partitioning optimization
-- Drop old partitions  
ALTER TABLE erc20_transfers DROP PARTITION '202301';  -- Drop January 2023

-- Optimize partition
OPTIMIZE TABLE erc20_transfers PARTITION '202412' FINAL;
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

```sql
-- Query performance analysis
SELECT 
    query,
    count() as executions,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
    sum(read_bytes) as total_read_bytes,
    sum(result_rows) as total_result_rows
FROM system.query_log
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
  AND type = 2  -- QueryFinish
  AND query NOT LIKE '%system.%'
GROUP BY query
ORDER BY avg_duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Table size and compression analysis
SELECT 
    database,
    table,
    sum(rows) as total_rows,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes)) as uncompressed_size,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_compressed_bytes)) as compressed_size,
    round(sum(data_compressed_bytes) / sum(data_uncompressed_bytes), 4) as compression_ratio,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) as disk_size
FROM system.parts 
WHERE active = 1
GROUP BY database, table
ORDER BY sum(bytes_on_disk) DESC;

-- Merge performance monitoring
SELECT 
    table,
    count() as merges_in_progress,
    sum(total_size_bytes_compressed) as total_merge_size,
    avg(progress) as avg_progress,
    max(elapsed) as max_elapsed_seconds
FROM system.merges
GROUP BY table;
```

### Index and Projection Usage

```sql
-- Check projection usage
SELECT 
    database,
    table, 
    name as projection_name,
    type,
    query_count,
    exception_count
FROM system.projections
ORDER BY query_count DESC;

-- Analyze primary key efficiency
SELECT 
    table,
    formatReadableSize(primary_key_bytes_in_memory) as pk_memory_size,
    primary_key_bytes_in_memory / marks as avg_pk_size_per_mark
FROM system.parts
WHERE active = 1
  AND table = 'erc20_transfers'
ORDER BY primary_key_bytes_in_memory DESC;
```
